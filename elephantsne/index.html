            <h1>Elephants and Other Megafauna of Nebraska</h1>
            <p>
                Megafauna were large mammals found during the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene Epoch lasted from around 2.6
                million
                years ago to around 12,000 years ago. The North American Ice Age peaked from 26,000 years ago to 12,000
                years ago.
                This era produced many incredible mammals.<br>
                Besides the Mammoths, Mastodons, and a saber-toothed cat that were found in Nebraska there were other
                wild
                creatures like the Giant Ground-Sloth the size of oxen. Nebraska hosted Woolly Rhinos and Dire Wolves.
                There was a
                beaver the size of a black bear and another beaver that burrowed underground like a prairie dog. <br>
                Did you know that camels and Lamas originated from North America? Four species of camels were found in
                Nebraska
                ranging from the Poebrotherium with the size of a beagle to the Gigantocamelus with the height of a
                giraffe and
                large canine teeth like a T Rex.
            </p>
            <h2>Why Did They Get so Big?</h2>
            <p>
                Without dinosaurs around to hunt them, the plains of Nebraska provided the herbivores the safety,
                food, and room to grow. But now they faced a different threat. Carnivores were able to grow also with
                the lack of
                competition from dinosaurs and like the herbivores, they had the food and room to grow big. This
                produced some
                truly weird and amazing creatures.
