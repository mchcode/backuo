                    Megafauna were large mammals found during the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene Epoch lasted from around
                    2.6 million to around 12,000 years ago and brought repeated glaciation periods with the last being
                    what we commonly refer to as the Ice Age. The North American Ice Age peaked from 25,000 to 18,000
                    years ago with a dry and cold climate. This era produced many incredible mammals.

                    Nebraska was home to many of these amazing mammals. Among those found in Nebraska were Woolly Rhinos, Dire Wolves, Saber-toothed cats, and many other odd creatures.  There was a beaver the size of a black bear and another beaver that burrowed underground like prairie dog. A Giant Ground-Sloth the size of oxen lumbered about.

                    Nebraska was home to many elephants like Mammoths and Mastodons. Fossil remains of elephants have
                    been found in every county in Nebraska. In 1967 the Mammoth was designated our State Fossil in
                    recognizion of
                    Archie, the World's Largest Elephant. Archie, a
                    Columbian mammoth, was found in Lincoln County and is on display in Elephant Hall at the
                    University
                    of Nebraska State Museum.
                    "It is estimated that there are at least 10 prehistoric elephant remains, on average, per square
                    mile
                    buried in Nebraska, more than there are living elephants in Africa.

                    Did you know that camels and lamas originated from North America? Four species of camels were found
                    in Nebraska ranging from the Poebrotherium with the size of a beagle to the Gigantocamelus with the
                    height of a giraffe and large canine teeth like a T Rex.

                <h2>Why Did They Get so Big?</h2>
                <p>
                    Without dinosaurs around to hunt them, the plains of Nebraska provided the herbivores the
                    safety, food, and room to grow. But now they faced a different threat. Carnivores were able to
                    grow also with the lack of competition from dinosaurs and like the herbivores, they had the food
                    and room to grow big. This produced some truly weird and amazing creatures.
