                <h2>How Did They Get Here?</h2>
                <p>
                    During the Ice Age, sea levels dropped 400 feet. Where the Bering Strait is today, A land bridge was
                    formed
                    between Asia and North America. It was called Beringia. At its greatest width, it spanned more than
                    1,000 miles
                    north to south. It was home to mammals and has been suggested as a home for early humans. While
                    mostly
                    treeless
                    plains, trees, and small bushes could be found in some areas. It was used as long ago as 1,800,000
                    years
                    ago for
                    migration to and from the two continents.<br>
                    This is the route that elephants originating in Africa found their way to Nebraska. The elephants
                    migrated to Asia
                    and into North America as their populations expanded while searching for new grazing areas. The
                    ice-free
                    corridor
                    through Beringia allowed them to cross. The Ice Cap of North America directed them towards Nebraska
                    where they
                    found favorable habitat.

                <h2> Why Did They Stay?</h2>
                <p>
                    Over the millions of years before the Pleistocene, Nebraska had many climates. with each hosting
                    unique
                    forms of
                    life.
                    During the Carboniferous, Nebraska was a swampy system place made of river deltas.<br>
                    During the Permian period, the state was mostly dry land but had many brackish and freshwater
                    habitats.<br>
                    In the Cretaceous period, Nebraska was covered by the Western Interior Seaway. Giant sharks and sea
                    turtles were
                    found along with Plesiosaurs. They looked like the Loch Ness Monster and grew to 40 feet long. Few
                    dinosaur
                    fossils are d found in Nebraska since the state was covered by the sea for most of the Jurassic
                    Period.<br>
                    When the sea retreated, the state became home to mammals like camels and rhinoceros. The Ice Age
                    brought
                    Nebraska
                    giant mammals like Mammoths and Mastodons. The arid grassy plains provided food for the early
                    herbivores
                    and the
                    moderate climate of the Ice Age made for a comfortable environment for the Megafauna.<br>
                    Nebraska has been a place of changing environments over time, but “life always finds a way.”
