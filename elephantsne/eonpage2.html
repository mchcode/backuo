                    During the Ice Age, sea levels dropped 400 feet. Where the Bering Strait is today, a land bridge was
                    formed between Asia and North America which was named Beringia. At its greatest width, it spanned
                    more than
                    1,000 miles north to south. Beringia was mostly treeless plains, although small trees and bushes
                    could be found in some areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beringia was used up to 1,800,000 years ago for migration to and from Asia to North America
                    continents.
                    This is the route that elephants originating in Africa used to find their way to Nebraska. The
                    elephants
                    migrated to Asia and into North America as their populations expanded and they searched for new
                    grazing areas. While other animals migrated with the elephants, there were some like camels that
                    migrated from North America to Asia.

                <h2> Why Did They Stay?</h2>
                <p>
                    In the Cretaceous period, Nebraska was covered by the Western Interior Seaway. Giant sharks and sea
                    turtles were found along with Plesiosaurs which looked like the Loch Ness Monster and grew to 40
                    feet long. Few dinosaur fossils are found in Nebraska since the state was covered by the sea for
                    most of the Jurassic Period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the sea retreated, Nebraska developed arid grassy plains which provided food for the early herbivores like camels, horses, elephants, and rhinoceros. When the Global Ice Cap began to push to the south, the advancing Ice Cap of
                    North America cooled the plains of Nebraska. As migrating animals followed the edge of the Ice Cap, they found the cold
                    and arid plains of  Ice Age Nebraska provided a comfortable environment for the Megafauna like Mammoths and Mastodons.
