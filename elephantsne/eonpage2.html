            <h2>How Did They Get Here?</h2>
    <p>
      During the Ice Age, sea levels dropped 400 feet. Where the Bering Strait is today, A land bridge was formed
      between Asia and North America. It was called Beringia. At its greatest width, it spanned more than 1,000 miles
      north to south. It was home to mammals and has been suggested as a home for early humans. While mostly treeless
      plains, trees, and small bushes could be found in some areas. It was used as long ago as 1,800,000 years ago for
      migration to and from the two continents.<br>
      This is the route that elephants originating in Africa found their way to Nebraska. The elephants migrated to Asia
      and into North America as their populations expanded while searching for new grazing areas. The ice-free corridor
      through Beringia allowed them to cross. The Ice Cap of North America directed them towards Nebraska where they
      found favorable habitat.

    <h2> Why Did They Stay?</h2>
    <p>
      Over the millions of years before the Pleistocene, Nebraska had many climates. with each hosting unique forms of
      life.
      During the Carboniferous, Nebraska was a swampy system place made of river deltas.<br>
      During the Permian period, the state was mostly dry land but had many brackish and freshwater habitats.<br>
      In the Cretaceous period, Nebraska was covered by the Western Interior Seaway. Giant sharks and sea turtles were
      found along with Plesiosaurs. They looked like the Loch Ness Monster and grew to 40 feet long. Few dinosaur
      fossils are d found in Nebraska since the state was covered by the sea for most of the Jurassic Period.<br>
      When the sea retreated, the state became home to mammals like camels and rhinoceros. The Ice Age brought Nebraska
      giant mammals like Mammoths and Mastodons. The arid grassy plains provided food for the early herbivores and the
      moderate climate of the Ice Age made for a comfortable environment for the Megafauna.<br>
      Nebraska has been a place of changing environments over time, but “life always finds a way.”<br> <b>(Edit text to
