                <p>
                    At different times during the Cenozoic, many types of elephants roamed the Nebraska landscape.
                    Four-tuskers, Stegomastodons, Mastodons, and Mammoths were some of the most common elephants in
                    Nebraska during the CenozoicThe earliest elephant found in Nebraska is the four-tusked elephant that
                    migrated from Asia to North America. The mammoths (elephants) did not reach our Nebraska, on the
                    southern edge of the glaciers, until the late Pleistocene Epoch, about one half million years ago.
                    Skeletal remains of elephants have been found in all parts of Nebraska, and many have been preserved
                    in the world famous Elephant Hall, on the campus of the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. "It is
                    estimated that there are at least 10 prehistoric elephant remains, on average, per square mile
                    buried in Nebraska---more than there are living elephants in Africa."

                    Savanna and grassland vegetation dominated the landscapeof Nebraska during the time of the
                    four-tuskers and stegamastodon.
                    Four-tuskers:
                    Four-tuskers migrated to North America from Asia and were present in Nebraska during the Middle and
                    Late Miocene. They are the oldest elephant
                    known to exist in Nebraska, Many of the four-tuskers remains have been found in
                    north-central Nebraska near the town of Valentine.

                    Stegomastodon:
                    Stegomastodon existed in Nebraska during the Pliocene They became extinct about 4 million years .
                    Stegomastodon remains have been found at many localities throughout Nebraska.
                    <br>
                    The climate in Nebraska was much cooler and drier because of the ice age in the Northern Hemisphere,
                    which started around 1.8 million years ago.
                    Mastodons:
                    Mastodons were present in Nebraska from 2 million until about 10,000 years ago. Mastodons ate shrubs
                    and pine trees in a grassland-dominated
                    ecosystem. Remains of Mastodons are found in the glacial deposits in the eastern part of Nebraska.
                    More bull dog in build than elephant.
                    Mammoths:
                    Mammoths are the most commonly found elephant fossil in Nebraska. Mammoths were present in Nebraska
                    from ~ 2 million until about 10,000 years ago. Various species of mammoth crossed the Bering Strait
                    land bridge about and spread throughout most of North America.<br>
                    The world's largest Mammoth skeleton was found
                    in Lincoln County, Nebraska; nicknamed "Archie." "When he was alive Archie must have been something
                    to behold. His height, at the shoulder, was 14', and he was still growing when he died. compares
                    with eight or nine feet for modern circus
                    elephants. His tusks were almost 13 feet long, and measured 33 in circumference at the base. He
                    would have weighed in at about 15 tons.
                    http://www.mccookgazette.com/story/1097462.html He is on display in the University of Nebraska State
                    Museum's world famous Elephant Hall. <br>
                    " In 1967, to commemorate the
                    100th Anniversary of our state, the legislature chose the Mammoth as our State Fossil, symbolized by
                    "Archie, the World's Largest Elephant."

                    Although the mammoth was an elephant, it was much larger than the modern elephant. Three main
                    species that have been found in Nebraska. are the Elephas primigenius, the Elephas columbi or
                    Columbian elephant, and the Elephas imperator or Imperial elephant. The Elephas primigenius, what we
                    recognize as a Wooly Mammoth, had a coat
                    of long, shaggy hair to protect it from the extreme cold of the north, and its remains are seldom
                    found south of Nebraska.<br>

                    Woolly mammoths
                    evolved a suite of adaptations for arctic life, including morphological traits such as small ears
                    and tails to minimize heat loss, a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, long thick fur, and numerous
                    sebaceous glands for insulation , as well as a large brown-fat hump like deposit behind the neck
                    that may have functioned as a heat source and fat reservoir during winter.[21]Vincent Lynch 2 july

                <h3>Mastodons</h3>
                <p>
                    Modern reconstructions based on partial and skeletal remains reveal that mastodons were very similar
                    in appearance to elephants and, to a lesser degree, mammoths, though not closely related to either
                    one. Compared to mammoths, mastodons had shorter legs and a longer body and were more heavily
                    muscled,[31] Lange, I.M. (2002). Ice Age Mammals of North America: A Guide to the Big, the Hairy,
                    and the Bizarre (illustrated ed.). Mountain Press Publishing. pp. 166â€“168. ISBN 0878424032.a build
                    similar to that of the current Asian elephants
                    They had a low and long skull with long curved tusks flat back Not shaggy like a Mammoth. Straight
                    tusk.

                    The American mastodon (M. americanum), which is one of the most widely distributed Pleistocene
                    proboscideans in North America. M. americanum fossil sites range in time from the Blancan to
                    Rancholabrean faunal stages and in locations from as far north as Alaska,as far east as Florida, and
                    as far south as the state of Puebla in central Mexico

                    A few isolated reports tell of mastodons being found along the east coast up to the New England
                    region,[43][44] with high concentrations in the Mid-Atlantic region

                <h2>Where Did They Go</h2>
                <p>
                    There is still an active debate on the extinction of elephants in North America. There are three
                    sides to the discussion. Some say they were hunted to extinction. Another side claims their
                    extinction was the result of climate change which killed the once abundant food source. The third
                    camp suggests that it was a combination of the two. The confusion comes from the arrival of humans
                    at the same time that climate change was changing the
                    landscape. Grasslands were changed to forests and other areas became hot and arid, destroying the
                    grazing grounds of the great herbivores.
