                <p>
                    There is still an active debate on the extinction of elephants in North America. There are three
                    sides to the discussion. Some say they were hunted to extinction. Another side claims their
                    extinction was the result of climate change which killed the once abundant food source. The third
                    camp suggests that it was a combination of the two. The confusion comes from the arrival of humans
                    at the same time that climate change was changing the
                    landscape. Grasslands were changed to forests and other areas became hot and arid, destroying the
                    grazing grounds of the great herbivores.
