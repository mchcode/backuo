                   During the era following the extiction of the dinosaurs, the the Cenozoic period, many elephants roamed the Nebraska landscape.
                   Gomphotheres, Stegomastodons, Mastodons, and Mammoths were the most common.The earliest elephant found in Nebraska is the  Gomphothere or four-tusked elephant.


                   The Mammoths did not reach our Nebraska, on the
                    southern edge of the glaciers, until the late Pleistocene Epoch, about one half million years ago.

                        The world's largest Mammoth skeleton was found
                        in Lincoln County, Nebraska; nicknamed "Archie." "When he was alive Archie must have been something
                        to behold. His height, at the shoulder, was 14', and he was still growing when he died. compares

                    "Skeletal remains of elephants have been found in all parts of Nebraska, and many have been
                    preserved in the world famous Elephant Hall, on the campus of the University of Nebraska in Lincoln.
                    It is estimated that there are at least 10 prehistoric elephant remains, on average, per square mile
                    buried in Nebraska---more than there are living elephants in Africa. In 1967, to commemorate the
                    100th Anniversary of our state, the legislature chose the Mammoth as our State Fossil, symbolized by
                    'Archie, the World's Largest Elephant.'"                    http://www.mccookgazette.com/story/1097462 . Archie was found in Lincoln County is on display in Elephant Hall.

                    Savanna and grassland vegetation dominated the landscapeof Nebraska during the time of the
                    four-tuskers and stegamastodon.
                    Four-tuskers:
                    Four-tuskers migrated to North America from Asia and were present in Nebraska during the Middle and
                    Late Miocene. The four-tuskers are the oldest elephant
                    known to exist in Nebraska.

                    The climate in Nebraska was much cooler and drier because of the ice age in the Northern Hemisphere,
                    which started around 1.8 million years ago.
                    Mastodons:
                    Mastodons were present in Nebraska from 2 million until about 10,000 years ago. Mastodons ate shrubs
                    and pine trees in a grassland-dominated
                    ecosystem. Remains of Mastodons are found in the glacial deposits in the eastern part of Nebraska.
                    More bull dog in build than elephant.
                    Mammoths:
                    Mammoths are the most commonly found elephant fossil in Nebraska. Mammoths were present in Nebraska
                    from ~ 2 million until about 10,000 years ago. Various species of mammoth crossed the Bering Strait
                    land bridge about and spread throughout most of North America.<br>

                    Although the mammoth was an elephant, it was much larger than the modern elephant. The three Mammoth
                    species found in Nebraska are the Columbian elephant, Imperial elephant and the shaggy Wooly Mammoth
                    which is seldom found south of Nebraska.
                    <p>

                        Woolly Mammoths
                        evolved adaptations for Arctic life like small ears
                        and tails to minimize heat loss, a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, long thick fur, and a large
                        fat hump behind the neck
                        that may have been a heat source and fat reservoir during winter.

                <p>
                    Mastodons were very similar
                    in appearance to elephants and less like Mammoths. Their build was
                    similar to current Asian elephants. Mastodons were found as far south as Florida and as far east as
                    the New England states.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compared to Mammoths, Mastodons had a longer, more muscler body with a flater back and shorter legs.
                    They were not shaggy like a Mammoth.
                    Mastodons had a low and long skull with long, slightly curved tusks which were straighter than the
                    very curved Mammoth tusks.

                <p>
                    There is still an active debate on the extinction of elephants in North America. There are three
                    sides to the discussion. Some say they were hunted to extinction. Another side claims their
                    extinction was the result of climate change which killed the once abundant food source. The third
                    camp suggests that it was a combination of the two. The confusion comes from the arrival of humans
                    at the same time that climate change was changing the
                    landscape. Grasslands were changed to forests and other areas became hot and arid, destroying the
                    grazing grounds of the great herbivores.
