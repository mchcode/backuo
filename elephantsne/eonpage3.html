                <p>
                    During the era following the extinction of the dinosaurs, the Cenozoic era, many elephants roamed
                    the Nebraska landscape. Four-tuskers, Stegomastodons, Mastodons, and Mammoths were the most common.
                    The ancestors of these elephants came over to North America from North Africa and Central Asia about
                    20 million years ago. The earliest elephants found in Nebraska were the Gomphotheres
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Amebelodon or "shovel-tusked" gomphothere first appeared in the Great Plains region of North
                    America roughly nine million years ago, then became extinct here around six million years ago when
                    severe drought set in.

                    Stegomastodon, also a gomphothere, was present in Nebraska from four million to 1.3 million years
                    ago. Stegomastdon was short and muscular, more bulldog than a leggy elephant. During the lives of
                    the Ameldon and Stegomastodon, Nebraska was a warm, grassy savanna. Trees and shrubs dotted the
                    landscape and resembled modern-day Africa.

                    Mastodons were present in Nebraska from 2 million until about 10,000 years ago. Rather than feeding
                    on grasses, mastodons browsed on shrubs, leaves, and pine tree branches. The climate in
                    Nebraska was much cooler and drier because of the ice age in the Northern Hemisphere, which started
                    around 1.8 million years ago.

                    Mammoths are the most commonly found elephant fossil in Nebraska. Mammoths were present in Nebraska
                    from two million until about ten thousand years ago. Woolly mammoths were grazers, eating a variety
                    of grasses, leaves, berries, nuts, and twigs. Scientists think they were still here
                    when the early man came into the Nebraska region, twelve thousand years ago.

                                Mastodons were very similar
                                in appearance to elephants and less like Mammoths. Their build was
                                similar to current Asian elephants. Mastodons were found as far south as Florida and as
                                far east
                                as
                                the New England states.

                                Compared to Mammoths, Mastodons had a longer, more muscler body with a flater back and
                                shorter
                                legs.
                                They were not shaggy like a Mammoth.
                                Mastodons had a low and long skull with long, slightly curved tusks which were
                                straighter than
                                the
                                very curved Mammoth tusks.

                    There is still an active debate on the extinction of elephants in North America. There are three
                    sides to the discussion. Some say they were hunted to extinction. Another side claims their
                    extinction was the result of climate change which killed the once abundant food source. The
                    third
                    camp suggests that it was a combination of the two. The confusion comes from the arrival of
                    humans
                    at the same time that climate change was changing the
                    landscape. Grasslands were changed to forests and other areas became hot and arid, destroying
                    the
                    grazing grounds of the great herbivores.
