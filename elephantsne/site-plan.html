    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>There was a time when Wooly Mammoths roamed Nebraska. Not only were there mastodons and mammoths, but there were
      also Wooly Rhinos, beavers the size of black bears, and four species of camels.
      When I mention these facts to others, they look at me like I may be crazy. I want my website, Elephants of
      Nebraska, to be a source of information to educate others about the wonderful and strange mammals that roamed
      Nebraska during the ice age.
      Would you like to learn about these incredible beasts?

    <h1>Elephants and Other Megafauna of Nebraska</h1>
    <p>
      Megafauna were large mammals found during the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene Epoch lasted from around 2.6 million
      to around 12,000 years ago and brought repeated glaciation periods with the last being what we commonly refer to as the Ice Age. with  The North American Ice Age peaked from 25,000 to 18,000 years ago with a dry and cold climate.
      This era produced many incredible mammals.<br>
      Besides the Mammoths, Mastodons, and a saber-toothed cat that were found in Nebraska there were other wild
      creatures like the Giant Ground-Sloth the size of oxen. Nebraska hosted Woolly Rhinos and Dire Wolves. There was a
      beaver the size of a black bear and another beaver that burrowed underground like a prairie dog. <br>
      Did you know that camels and Lamas originated from North America? Four species of camels were found in Nebraska
      ranging from the Poebrotherium with the size of a beagle to the Gigantocamelus with the height of a giraffe and
      large canine teeth like a T Rex.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Did They Get so Big?</h2>
    <p>
      Without dinosaurs around to hunt them, the plains of Nebraska provided the herbivores the safety,
      food, and room to grow. But now they faced a different threat. Carnivores were able to grow also with the lack of
      competition from dinosaurs and like the herbivores, they had the food and room to grow big. This produced some
      truly weird and amazing creatures.

    <h1>Why Nebraska?</h1>
    <h2>How Did They Get Here?</h2>
    <p>
      During the Ice Age, sea levels dropped 400 feet. Where the Bering Strait is today, A land bridge was formed
      between Asia and North America. It was called Beringia. At its greatest width, it spanned more than 1,000 miles
      north to south. It was home to mammals and has been suggested as a home for early humans. While mostly treeless
      plains, trees, and small bushes could be found in some areas. It was used as long ago as 1,800,000 years ago for
      migration to and from the two continents.<br>
      This is the route that elephants originating in Africa found their way to Nebraska. The elephants migrated to Asia
      and into North America as their populations expanded while searching for new grazing areas. The ice-free corridor
      through Beringia allowed them to cross. The Ice Cap of North America directed them towards Nebraska where they
      found favorable habitat.
    </p>
    <h2> Why Did They Stay?</h2>
    <p>
      Over the millions of years before the Pleistocene, Nebraska had many climates. with each hosting unique forms of
      life.
      During the Carboniferous, Nebraska was a swampy system place made of river deltas.<br>
      During the Permian period, the state was mostly dry land but had many brackish and freshwater habitats.<br>
      In the Cretaceous period, Nebraska was covered by the Western Interior Seaway. Giant sharks and sea turtles were
      found along with Plesiosaurs. They looked like the Loch Ness Monster and grew to 40 feet long. Few dinosaur
      fossils are d found in Nebraska since the state was covered by the sea for most of the Jurassic Period.<br>
      When the sea retreated, the state became home to mammals like camels and rhinoceros. The Ice Age brought Nebraska
      giant mammals like Mammoths and Mastodons. The arid grassy plains provided food for the early herbivores and the
      moderate climate of the Ice Age made for a comfortable environment for the Megafauna.<br>
      Nebraska has been a place of changing environments over time, but “life always finds a way.”<br> <b>(Edit text to

    <h1>Mammoths and Mastodons</h1>
<p>
  At different times during the Cenozoic, many types of elephants roamed the Nebraska landscape.
  Four-tuskers, Stegomastodons, Mastodons, and Mammoths were some of the most common elephants in
  Nebraska during the Cenozoic
  The hay day for Mammoths and Mastodons were 2 million years ao to 10,000 years ago, but other
  elephants preceded them and went extinct before this period. The earliest elephant found in Nebraska
  is the four-tusked elephant that migrated from Asia to North America. Gomphotheres-
  Elephantidae-Mammoths The mammoths (elephants) did not reach our Nebraska, on the southern edge of
  the glaciers, until the late Pleistocene Epoch, about one half million years ago.

  Four-tuskers:
  Four-tuskers migrated to North America from Asia and were present in Nebraska during the Middle and
  Late Miocene. Remains of four-tuskers are found in the Ogallala Group. They are the oldest elephant
  known to exist in Nebraska, and were surrounded by savanna and grassland vegetation, which was
  present on the Miocene landscape in Nebraska. Many of the four-tuskers remains have been found in
  north-central Nebraska near the town of Valentine.

  Stegomastodon:
  Stegomastodon existed in Nebraska during the Pliocene deposition of the Broadwater Formation. They
  became extinct about 4 million years ago. Savanna and grassland vegetation dominated the landscape
  of Nebraska during the Pliocene. Stegomastodon remains have been found at many localities throughout
  Nebraska.

  Mastodons:
  Mastodons were present in Nebraska from 2 million until about 10,000 years ago. The climate in
  Nebraska was much cooler and drier because of the ice age in the Northern Hemisphere, which started
  around 1.8 million years ago. Mastodons ate shrubs and pine trees in a grassland-dominated
  ecosystem. Remains of Mastodons are found in the glacial deposits in the eastern part of Nebraska.

  Mammoths:
  Mammoths are the most commonly found elephant fossil in Nebraska. Mammoths were present in Nebraska
  from ~ 2 million until about 10,000 years ago. Various species of mammoth crossed the Bering Strait
  land bridge about and spread throughout most of North America.
   In 1967, the state of Nebraska
  designated the Mammoth as the official state fossil. The world's largest Mammoth skeleton was found
  in Lincoln County, Nebraska; nicknamed "Archie." This extremelylarge Mammoth is on display in the
  University of Nebraska State Museum
  Skeletal remains of elephants have been found in all parts of Nebraska, and many have been preserved
  in the world famous Elephant Hall, on the campus of the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. "It is
  estimated that there are at least 10 prehistoric elephant remains, on average, per square mile
  buried in Nebraska---more than there are living elephants in Africa."" In 1967, to commemorate the
  100th Anniversary of our state, the legislature chose the Mammoth as our State Fossil, symbolized by
  "Archie, the World's Largest Elephant." "compares with eight or nine feet for modern circus
  elephants. His tusks were almost 13 feet long, and measured 33 in circumference at the base. He
  would have weighed in at about 15 tons. He must have made the earth shake, as he roamed the hills
  along Medicine Creek in what is now Frontier and Lincoln Counties.""

    <h3>Mammoths</h3>
    <p>
      the mammoth, (Elephas primigenius,) officially became Nebraska's state fossil with a bill passed by
      the Legislature on Nebraska's 100th birthday, March 1, 1967. The world's largest Mammoth skeleton
      was found in Lincoln County, Nebraska; nicknamed Archie.

      Although the mammoth was an elephant, it was much larger than the modern elephant. The three main
      species that have been found in Nebraska are the Elephas primigenius, the Elephas columbi or
      Columbian elephant, and the Elephas imperator or Imperial elephant. Elephas primigenius had a coat
      of long, shaggy hair to protect it from the extreme cold of the north, and its remains are seldom
      found south of Nebraska.

      Scientists discovered and studied the remains of a mammoth calf, and found that fat greatly
      influenced its form, and enabled it to store large amounts of nutrients necessary for survival in
      temperatures as low as −50 °C (−58 °F).[19] The fat also allowed the mammoths to increase their
      muscle mass, allowing the mammoths to fight against enemies and live longer.[20] Woolly mammoths
      evolved a suite of adaptations for arctic life, including morphological traits such as small ears
      and tails to minimize heat loss, a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, long thick fur, and numerous
      sebaceous glands for insulation , as well as a large brown-fat hump like deposit behind the neck
      that may have functioned as a heat source and fat reservoir during winter.[21]Vincent Lynch 2 july

    <h3>Mastodons</h3>
    <p>
      Modern reconstructions based on partial and skeletal remains reveal that mastodons were very similar
      in appearance to elephants and, to a lesser degree, mammoths, though not closely related to either
      one. Compared to mammoths, mastodons had shorter legs and a longer body and were more heavily
      muscled,[31] Lange, I.M. (2002). Ice Age Mammals of North America: A Guide to the Big, the Hairy,
      and the Bizarre (illustrated ed.). Mountain Press Publishing. pp. 166–168. ISBN 0878424032.a build
      similar to that of the current Asian elephants

      They had a low and long skull with long curved tusks flat back Not shaggy

      The range of most species of Mammut is unknown as their occurrences are restricted to few
      localities, the exception being the American mastodon (M. americanum), which is one of the most
      widely distributed Pleistocene proboscideans in North America. M. americanum fossil sites range in
      time from the Blancan to Rancholabrean faunal stages and in locations from as far north as Alaska,
      as far east as Florida, and as far south as the state of Puebla in central Mexico

      A few isolated reports tell of mastodons being found along the east coast up to the New England
      region,[43][44] with high concentrations in the Mid-Atlantic region

    <h2>Where Did They Go</h2>
    <p>
      There is still an active debate on the extinction of elephants in North America. There are three sides to the
      discussion. Some say they were hunted to extinction. Another side claims their extinction was the result of
      climate change which killed the once abundant food source. The third camp suggests that it was a combination of
      the two. The confusion comes from the arrival of humans at the same time that climate change was changing the
      landscape. Grasslands were changed to forests and other areas became hot and arid, destroying the grazing grounds
      of the great herbivores.
