    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>There was a time when Wooly Mammoths roamed Nebraska. Not only were there mastodons and mammoths, but there were
      also Wooly Rhinos, beavers the size of black bears, and four species of camels.
      When I mention these facts to others, they look at me like I may be crazy. I want my website, Elephants of
      Nebraska, to be a source of information to educate others about the wonderful and strange mammals that roamed
      Nebraska during the ice age.
      Would you like to learn about these incredible beasts?

    <h1>Elephants and Other Megafauna of Nebraska</h1>
    <p>
      Megafauna were large mammals found during the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene Epoch lasted from around 2.6 million
      years ago to around 12,000 years ago. The North American Ice Age peaked from 26,000 years ago to 12,000 years ago.
      This era produced many incredible mammals.<br>
      Besides the Mammoths, Mastodons, and a saber-toothed cat that were found in Nebraska there were other wild
      creatures like the Giant Ground-Sloth the size of oxen. Nebraska hosted Woolly Rhinos and Dire Wolves. There was a
      beaver the size of a black bear and another beaver that burrowed underground like a prairie dog. <br>
      Did you know that camels and Lamas originated from North America? Four species of camels were found in Nebraska
      ranging from the Poebrotherium with the size of a beagle to the Gigantocamelus with the height of a giraffe and
      large canine teeth like a T Rex.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Did They Get so Big?</h2>
    <p>
      Without dinosaurs around to hunt them, the plains of Nebraska provided the herbivores the safety,
      food, and room to grow. But now they faced a different threat. Carnivores were able to grow also with the lack of
      competition from dinosaurs and like the herbivores, they had the food and room to grow big. This produced some
      truly weird and amazing creatures.

    <h1>Why Nebraska?</h1>
    <h2>How Did They Get Here?</h2>
    <p>
      During the Ice Age, sea levels dropped 400 feet. Where the Bering Strait is today, A land bridge was formed
      between Asia and North America. It was called Beringia. At its greatest width, it spanned more than 1,000 miles
      north to south. It was home to mammals and has been suggested as a home for early humans. While mostly treeless
      plains, trees, and small bushes could be found in some areas. It was used as long ago as 1,800,000 years ago for
      migration to and from the two continents.<br>
      This is the route that elephants originating in Africa found their way to Nebraska. The elephants migrated to Asia
      and into North America as their populations expanded while searching for new grazing areas. The ice-free corridor
      through Beringia allowed them to cross. The Ice Cap of North America directed them towards Nebraska where they
      found favorable habitat.
    </p>
    <h2> Why Did They Stay?</h2>
    <p>
      Over the millions of years before the Pleistocene, Nebraska had many climates. with each hosting unique forms of
      life.
      During the Carboniferous, Nebraska was a swampy system place made of river deltas.<br>
      During the Permian period, the state was mostly dry land but had many brackish and freshwater habitats.<br>
      In the Cretaceous period, Nebraska was covered by the Western Interior Seaway. Giant sharks and sea turtles were
      found along with Plesiosaurs. They looked like the Loch Ness Monster and grew to 40 feet long. Few dinosaur
      fossils are d found in Nebraska since the state was covered by the sea for most of the Jurassic Period.<br>
      When the sea retreated, the state became home to mammals like camels and rhinoceros. The Ice Age brought Nebraska
      giant mammals like Mammoths and Mastodons. The arid grassy plains provided food for the early herbivores and the
      moderate climate of the Ice Age made for a comfortable environment for the Megafauna.<br>
      Nebraska has been a place of changing environments over time, but “life always finds a way.”<br> <b>(Edit text to

    <h2>Where Did They Go</h2>
    <p>
      There is still an active debate on the extinction of elephants in North America. There are three sides to the
      discussion. Some say they were hunted to extinction. Another side claims their extinction was the result of
      climate change which killed the once abundant food source. The third camp suggests that it was a combination of
      the two. The confusion comes from the arrival of humans at the same time that climate change was changing the
      landscape. Grasslands were changed to forests and other areas became hot and arid, destroying the grazing grounds
      of the great herbivores.
